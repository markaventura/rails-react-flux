WTF
---------------
An empty starting point for a stateless Ruby API using the rails-api gem, with a React client side app. To fit the definition of stateless, the API does not include action-view, sprockets, or sessions. Roughly speaking, React replaces action-view, Webpack replaces sprockets, and JWT replaces sessions.

Installation
---------------
* Run `npm install`
* Run `bundle install`
* Start rails `rails s`
* Run `npm run devserve`
* Go to `localhost:8080` to display the app
